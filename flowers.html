            Create a website for an anti-racist organization geared toward teen girls and their parents. The client had a webpage on their own unrelated website, but the overlapping websites were causing confusion, and as the organization was growing, Her Flowers needed its own website.

          <h2>Meet the Founders</h2>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="below">
            This year, the Her Flowers organization emerged as a space for female-identifying teenagers to talk about current events, race, privilege, and learn how to be better allies. The website needed to cater to these teens as well as adults who might want to get involved with lectures and workshops. Currently, the organization had a single webpage on the founder’s personal website, which was confusing to users. As the organization grew, the founders needed a real website.
          </p>

          <p>
            To kick off the project, the founders sent out a project brief. Then we met to determine a timeline and discuss our roles in the project.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Speak with Teens</h2>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="below">
            I started the process with user interviews. Because Her Flowers had already been operating for nearly a year, I was eager to tap into their resources and gain insight from their existing users. My goal was to interview three key groups: parents and adults familiar with Her Flowers, teenagers familiar with Her Flowers, and teenagers unfamiliar with Her Flowers. I wanted to understand both how current users found Her Flowers and how they were using the website, as well as how we might attract new users.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’ve found that recruiting and scheduling user interviews always take longer than expected, and this was no exception. However, it was especially difficult to get responses from the teenagers, possibly due to the fact that the end of the school year was approaching. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to get as many interviews with teens as I was hoping to, but to stay on track, I needed to move forward with the information I had.
          </p>

          <p>
            Using the information from the interviews that I was able to conduct, I created an affinity map to organize the data and track trends.
        </div>

        <div class="containerSmall">

            <source srcset="img/flowers/affinity@1x.jpg" media="(max-width: 767px)">
            <img class="small" src="img/flowers/affinity@2x.jpg" alt="Her Flowers Affinity Map">
          </picture>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            From this data, I was able to pull out key insights and begin to ideate about features. These findings also guided me in creating two user personas, one for teens, and one for adults, in order to empathize with all users.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="containerSmall">
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/flowers/teen@1x.jpg" media="(max-width: 767px)">
            <img class="small" src="img/flowers/teen@2x.jpg" alt="Teenager User Persona">

        </div>

        <div class="containerSmall">
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/flowers/parent@1x.jpg" media="(max-width: 767px)">
            <img class="small" src="img/flowers/parent@2x.jpg" alt="Adult User Persona">
          </picture>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Delight with Data</h2>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="below">
            Next, I presented the data, key findings, and personas to the founders. Because they weren’t familiar with the process of UI and UX, it was important to keep them in the loop so they could understand the process and the reasoning behind my work. It was a joy to bring the practice of UI/UX into their organization, and they were thrilled about the results of the interviews, and full of ideas. Using the research, we were able to start ideating as a group about different aspects of the website. Together, we developed the idea of creating a collage style for the website.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then, I used the user personas to help create user stories and continue ideating on the website. In the meantime, I sent the founders worksheets to help me understand their business goals and voice in order to develop their brand and website. Early on, I had communicated that I wanted to understand these things, but I learned as I went that this request needed more structure. Finding a few guides and workshops online to send them helped them send me exactly what I needed to understand their vision.
          </p>

          <p>
            With a better sense of the problem space and the needs of the users, I dove into competitor research. Although Her Flowers doesn’t have any direct competitors, I was able to research and gain inspiration from other teen and/or activism websites.
          </p>

          <p>
            Based on the user research, ideation with the founders, and their initial project brief, I developed a list of site pages. In order to understand how best to organize the site, I conducted a card sort, and used the results to create a site map.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Mock it Up</h2>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="below">
            Finally, I was ready to create low-fi wireframes, drawing upon my research and insights. I presented these to the founders and received and integrated their feedback.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the same time, I began working on the logo and brand design, working through several versions of the logo and iterating based on feedback. I created a moodboard, color palette, and style guide, which I drew upon to create custom digital collages. I also created a custom icon set for their impact metrics.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="containerSmall">

            <img class="small" src="img/flowers/mood@2x.jpg" alt="Her Flowers Moodboard">
          </picture>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            Next, I began polishing the wireframes to mid-fidelity and created a working prototype in Figma to conduct user testing. I recruited participants from the original group, and again struggled to get responses from the Her Flowers teens. Regardless, I was able to find 5 people to test with, some familiar with Her Flowers and some unfamiliar. In the end, this turned out to be a positive development, as users unfamiliar with the group weren’t immediately sure what Her Flowers was from the website--obviously, a high priority to fix. I used the results of the user testing to create an error rating system and made changes as needed.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>The Medium is the Message</h2>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="below">
            Finally, the time had come to choose a platform to host the website. There were several options available, and choosing one required balancing the budget and needs of the founders who would be maintaining it with the capabilities of the platform. Because I had only worked with engineers to build a site from code in the past, I wasn’t familiar with website builders, and I sought advice from several mentors to help me in my decision. I also did some research on my own, and finally decided to work with Squarespace, to make it easy for the founders to maintain and update.
          </p>

          <p>
            At this point, communication and collaboration with the founders became especially important. For that reason, I created an Asana board to keep track of tasks and timelines. Despite the fact that the founders and I were spread across time zones, the Asana board helped us communicate effectively as a team, and ensured that no task slipped through the cracks.
          </p>

          <p>
            While the founders coordinated the website content and various other details, I built the website in Squarespace, which turned out to be limited in more ways than I’d anticipated. Compared with manipulating components pixel by pixel in Figma, building in Squarespace was much less flexible. I wasn’t able to build everything to the exact specifications I’d set in the Figma, which was frustrating. I learned that I much prefer working with engineers, although I would love to try no-code platforms like Webflow.
          </p>
        </div>

            <div>
              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p class="below">
                Finally, the first draft of the site was complete. I received another round feedback and revisions from the founders, and iterated upon the design until the website was complete and ready to launch.
              </p>

              <p>
                Being able to bring the Her Flowers website to life was a rewarding experience, despite the frustrations of Squarespace. In some ways, this internship was a crash course in the client/freelancer relationship, which brought unique challenges and considerations. Although I’m not planning on working with Squarespace anytime soon, it was a fantastic learning experience.

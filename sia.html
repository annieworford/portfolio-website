          <h2>Start with the big picture</h2>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="below">
            When I joined Sia, the founder had already done quite a bit of competitor research, including years of using other apps. He came into the endeavour with lots of ideas about features and functionalities, as well as the needs and pain points of our users. This broad knowledge base, translated into a MVP Product Requirements Document, gave us the big picture. Some features had already been fleshed out by the founder, and some we pinned down together through extended brainstorming sessions throughout the process, talking through ideas and problem solving.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Fill in the details</h2>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="below">
            For the details, I did my own competitive analysis of key competitors to gain an understanding of the market. As someone unfamiliar with the type of product, I was able to bring a fresh perspective, free of any assumptions.
          </p>

          <p>
            With an understanding of how others were approaching the problem, it was time to start designing. I created low-fi wireframes for the onboarding flow in Figma.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="containerSmall">
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/sia/lowfi@1x.jpg" media="(max-width: 767px)">

          </picture>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            Then, I worked to refine them and bring them up to hi-fidelity. At the same time, I began determining the look and feel of the app, and building a components library to track different components and their states. I decided on a font, color palette (based on inspiration from the founder), and a few basic UI elements like buttons. At this point, I also created a logo.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="containerSmall">
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/sia/old@1x.jpg" media="(max-width: 767px)">
            <img class="small" src="img/sia/old@2x.jpg" alt="Sia Original Sign Up Screen">
          </picture>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
          These UI components allowed me to largely skip low fidelity wireframes, and continue to build out the app in high fidelity, feature by feature. I continued building up the components library as I went, accounting for edge cases and error states as the engineers needed them. I also annotated the screens with arrows and notes to make interactions and relationships between screens clear.
          </p>

          <p>
            Partway through building the wireframes, we decided to modernize the look and feel of the app with a UI redesign. I updated the color palette, font, and components to reflect a lighter, brighter, more modern look. Then, I applied any remaining changes to the wireframes.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>

          </picture>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            When I finished hi-fi wireframes for every feature and section of the webapp, it was time to bring everything up to pixel perfection, align elements to the grid, and tidy up the organization of the Figma file, including the components page, to make it easier for the engineers to work with.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Make it responsive</h2>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="below">
            Now that the wireframes were finalized, I again turned to competitor research to see how competitors dealt with responsivity and mobile apps. Using this research, I created and designed two new breakpoints.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="containerSmall">
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/sia/breakpoint1@1x.jpg" media="(max-width: 767px)">

        <div class="containerMedium">

          </picture>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            Next, I designed the native iOS app in high-fidelity, starting with the home screen. Once I had the look and components determined from the home screen, I designed the rest of the app. Overall, my aim was to keep the interactions and design as similar to the web app as possible, while optimizing it for mobile. As I worked, I added a mobile section to the components library where new or altered components were needed for mobile.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="containerTiny">
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/sia/mobile@1x.jpg" media="(max-width: 767px)">
            <img class="small" src="img/sia/mobile@2x.jpg" alt="Sia Sign Up Screen Mobile">
          </picture>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            Finally, I created a working prototype to audited the mobile designs one last time for anything missing or anything that could be improved. Ultimately, I decided that the prototype wasnâ€™t a useful tool with the layout of the document, but it was still useful to view key screens on my phone to get a better sense of how things looked on mobile.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Prepare for take off</h2>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="below">
            I researched the landing page and website of a few competitors, and began to design our waitlist website, moving from low to high fidelity. Overall, I kept the components the same as those of the webapp, with a few key changes, including making the font larger to adjust from the detail-oriented web app to a bold, digestible, marketing website. To reflect any changes, I created a small components library from the waitlist website.
          </p>

          <p>
            Throughout the process, I worked with engineers, iterating upon the document for improved usability for their processes based on feedback. Through iteration, we found a system of organization that worked best for us, including consistent naming, labeling, and numbering. I labelled interactions with arrows, included quotes for interactions that needed explanation, and organized flows around interactions.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="containerMedium">
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/sia/flows@1x.jpg" media="(max-width: 767px)">
            <img class="small" src="img/sia/flows@2x.jpg" alt="Sia Figma Organization">
          </picture>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            Additionally, I engaged in light user testing for interactions and elements that we suspected might not be intuitive. This user testing helped to quickly validate or discard ideas to improve and iterate on the prototype.
          </p>
        </div>

            <div>
              <h2>Design a System</h2>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p>
                After the initial MVP sprints, we decided that it was time to put a design system in place. This would allow us to document how components were being used in each instance, and help create a scalable, logical system for ourselves and other designers in the future.
              </p>

              <p>
                To address this need, I compiled screenshots of key elements within the system and combined them with documentation in a comprehensive design system document.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p>
                As soon as the engineers have finished designing the app, we plan to engage in thorough bug testing. Then, weâ€™ll launch the waitlist website and open the app up to a limited number of beta testers. After the period of beta testing, during which Iâ€™ll iterate based on feedback from users, weâ€™ll launch to the waitlist and the public, and begin working on post-MVP as well as continuing to listen to and iterate based on user feedback.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p class="below">
                Five months in the making, this project has been a phenomenal learning experience in working closely with engineers, as well as iterating based on feedback. From the very first drafts of wireframes to the final, pixel-perfect screens, I can see how much Iâ€™ve grown as a designer.
              </p>

              <p>
                This project has also given me invaluable experience in designing across the spectrum of devices, including adapting components and screens for responsivity and native mobile apps. Working across devices also laid the groundwork for the design system, and furthered my understanding of the importance of such a system. The only thing I mightâ€™ve done differently was creating a design system earlier in the process to streamline the process and keep things consistent from early on, rather than going back to retroactively make things consistent. Detailing out the internal logic sooner wouldâ€™ve made translating the design across screens much easier and faster.

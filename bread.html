            Bread & Butter is a responsive web app designed to replace aimlessly googling for recipes and make it easy for users to find the perfect recipe for their needs. I worked on both the UX and UI for this app, and used Adobe XD to make it.
            The goal of this project was to create an app that users would be able to go to and know that they would find something that worked for their lifestyle and tastes. The app would replace aimlessly googling for recipes and allow users to
            arrive on the perfect dish faster and more easily.

            I began with a SWOT analysis of other recipe apps because I wanted to see how other apps were attempting to solve the problem, and where they were falling short. In the future, however, I would leave this step for a little later in the process, because I've learned recently that beginning by looking at other apps can bias you and narrow down your thinking when you begin to wireframe. Below is my SWOT analysis for Kitchen Stories.

            My user research allowed me to clarify and define the users' perspective and goals. I used these insights to create user personas in order to keep the users' interests in mind at every stage.

            These personas and interviws allowed me to identify several jobs to be done. In order to create a Minimum Viable Product, I narrowed these down to the most important ones, following the principles of lean UX and leaving less vital features for a later iteration. Essential jobs to be done included: saving recipes for later use, filtering recipes to get customized results in order to narrow down options, and sorting recipes by image, quickly and efficiently.
          <p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            Armed with a list of JTBDs, the next step was to figure out how to organize them and what steps each job would require. To determine this, I created a user flow diagram to guide me in wireframing.
          </p>

            Next, I moved on to wireframing in order to start designing solutions. I first sketched on paper, which I still prefer to digital wireframes for very early lo-fi wireframes because it keeps the process very rough and fluid. Working on paper means I don't get caught up in pixels until later.
          </p>

        <div>
          <p>
            I used the Marvel app to animate these low fidelity paper wireframes and moved on to my first round of user testing. This was a great learning experience, if not a great testing experience. Although it might save time, testing with paper wireframes is difficult and ultimately not ideal. This experience taught me the importance of an understandable prototype. Besides, it's very hard for users to envision the final product when it's so rough. If you're testing the legibility of your handwriting or your ability to draw an arrow, it's difficult to test the prototype at the same time.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond the limits of the prototype, users were confused by several aspects of the app, and I had some corrections to make. But testing early meant that I didn’t put in too much effort to develop something that didn’t work--I just wouldn't test quite so early next time.
            Although aspects of the app needed a redesign, it wasn’t a costly mistake, because I was figuring these mistakes out early in the process. In order to determine what to focus my time on, I rated each in terms of urgency to fix. The biggest
            change that came out of this user feedback was that I created a sign up/login pop-up that came up right away when the app was first opened.

              <p>
                Now that I had my wireframes in order, I pivoted to finding inspiration, and creating a few moodboards. For each moodboard, I focused on one aspect of cooking and used colors, textures, and typography to evoke these emotions. In the end, I choose to move forward with the moodboard that focused on the creative, playful aspects of cooking, because I wanted to make the app accessible and fun for my users. Using this moodboard and these keywords, I created a complete style guide for my app so that I could move forwards with consisent UI.

                Next, I translated a few of my wireframes at each breakpoint into mockups so that I could receive feedback on the UI and the responsive design. I designed with 12 columns for each breakpoint to give me the most flexibility possible.

                   I presented these screens to a few fellow designers for feedback.

                  <p>
                    As with the user testing, I made sure to prioritize the most important fixes so I could spend my time effectively. The general consensus from the first round of critique was that people liked the unique hexagon shape from the smaller breakpoints, but wanted it to be carried through to larger breakpoints. In answer, decided to take the
                    triangular sections from the hexagon and use that diagonal slant to break up the main image at the larger breakpoints. I also changed the header picture because I got feedback that the orange overlay wasn’t working well, and I
                    wanted to try a different picture. The lack of variety in the font also emerged as an issue, so I added a second font to work in tandem with the first. Finally, I was advised to make the sign in/sign up sidebar consistent between the two largest
                    breakpoints, and to change the navigation system.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Below is the new iteration of the home screen, with changes from the critique.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div class="containerSmall">

                </div>

                <div>
                  <p>
                    In the second round of critique, the main change was the navigation system, which went through several iterations and locations on the screen throughout the process. In the end, I moved it back to the bottom of the screen for the smaller screen sizes, in order to make it easy for users to reach the button without having to shift their phones around.
                  </p>

                <div>
                  <p>
                  Ultimately, I felt I accomplished what I set out to do, although there are other features I would add in a second iteration, particularly the ability for users to leave comments on recipes. Overall, the project was a great opportunity to learn. For one thing, I learned how difficult it is to conduct a good user test with a bad prototype. In the future, I'll test with digital wireframes only. I also learned the importance of working in breaks, even in the home stretch. For the last leg of the project, I vastly underestimated how much time it would take, and ended up pushing through without breaks for an extra three days, trying to get everything done. In the future, I would make sure to plan my time more realistically and build in time for myself. Finally, if I were to have more time on this project, I would also test the product again after implementation to ensure it was working well. I would also run a card sort to validate my categories and ensure it is as easy as possible to search for recipes. For now, here is the final product.

          Bread & Butter is a responsive web app designed to replace aimlessly googling for recipes and make it easy for users to find the perfect recipe for their needs. I worked on both the UX and UI for this app, and used Adobe XD to make it. The goal of this project was to create an app that users would be able to go to and know that they would find something that worked for their lifestyle and tastes. The app would replace aimlessly googling for recipes and allow users to arrive on the perfect dish faster and more easily. I was responsible for both the UI and UX for this project.

          <h2>My Process</h2>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            I began with a swot analysis of other recipe apps and then user interviews. From the interviews, I created user personas to assist me in clarifying the needs of my users.

        <div>
          <p>
            From these personas and from my interviews, I identified key features that users wanted, which further shaped my goals. The users I interviewed emphasized several features, which I narrowed down to the most important ones, following the principles of lean UX and leaving less vital features for a later iteration. Essential features included: being able to save recipes for later, being able to filter to get customized results, and being able to see clear visuals of the recipe immediately.
          <p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            Armed with the knowledge of potential users and a list of must-have features, I determined what user flows the app structure would need to support and combined them into a user flow diagram.
          </p>
        </div>

        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            From there, I moved on to wireframing, which I first sketched on paper.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>

        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            I used the Marvel app to animate these low fidelity paper wireframes and moved on to my next round of user testing.
          </p>

          <p>
            At this point, I reached my first major challenge. Users were confused by several aspects of the app, and I had some corrections to make. But testing early meant that I didn’t put in too much effort to develop something that didn’t work. Although aspects of the app needed a redesign, it wasn’t a costly mistake, because I was figuring these mistakes out early in the process. In order to determine what to prioitize, I rated each in terms of urgency to fix. The biggest change that came out of this user feedback was that I created a sign up/login pop-up that came up right away when the app was first opened.
          </p>
        <div>

        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            Now that I had my wireframes in order, I pivoted to finding inspiration, creating a moodboard, and finally, creating a complete style guide for my app.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            Next, I translated a few of my wireframes into mockups and put them through another round of feedback, this time from other designers, rather than users.

          <p>
            The general consensus from the first round of critique was that people liked the unique hexagon shape from the smaller breakpoints, but wanted it to be carried through to larger breakpoints. In answer, decided to take the triangular sections from the hexagon and use that diagonal slant to break up the main image at the larger breakpoints. I also changed the header picture because I got feedback that the orange overlay wasn’t working well, and I wanted to try a different picture. The lack of variety in the font emerged as another major issue, so I added a second font. Finally, I was advised to make the sign in/sign up sidebar consistent between the two largest breakpoints, and to change the navigation system.
          </p>

          <p>
            Below is the iteration of the home screen, with changes from the critique.

        <div>
          <p>
            In the second round of critique, the main change was the navigation system, which went through several iterations and locations on the screen throughout the process. Ultimately, I felt I accomplished what I set out to do, although there are other features I would add in a second iteration, particularly the ability for users to leave comments on recipes. Here is the final product.

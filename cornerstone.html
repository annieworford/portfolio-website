          Cornerstone is a money saving platform that combines the ease and convenience of an app with the security of a traditional banking institution. I worked on both the UX and UI for this app, which I made using Sketch. Built to make financial
          advising accessible and understandable for everyone, Cornerstone is a simple way to plan for the future and create saving goals you can stick to. I was responsible for both the UX and the UI for this project.

          In order to build the app, I was given a project brief, which laid out the problem and some of the solution, and included user stories. I used these stories to create a user flow diagram so that I could start mapping out paths for users.

        <p>
          From here, I began wireframing on paper, which I then digitized in Balsamiq. Although it was interesting to learn how to use Balsamiq, I ultimately didn't find it to be a useful step. It took me longer to sort through different components to add to the canvas that it would have to just draw them in Sketch. Plus, had they started out in Sketch, I wouldn't have had to translate them again. Ultimately, I'm glad I tried Balsamiq out, but in the future I think it's more efficient to move directly to Sketch.

      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          After creating low and then mid-fidelity wireframes in Sketch, I tested these mid-fidelity screens with users in order to make sure my screens were intuitive and easy to use. I consolidated and prioritized the feedback I received, determining which issues were the highest priority to be fixed. There were several small
          issues such as spelling mistakes that were easily fixed, and a few issues that were larger and needed rethinking, such as confusion about navigation on the dashboard page.

      <div>
        <p>
          As I worked through these various issues, I continued to refine my wireframes. Major changes included adding tabs to the dashboard to navigate between monthly, weekly, and daily savings; hiding the
          block of photo options on the new plan page to streamline the process for users who want to skip this step; and adding the profile icon to the add a friend button to clarify what this icon means.

        <h2 id="ui">Define UI</h2>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          Because it was a banking app, I wanted to be very careful about establishing trust and consistency within the app, so I created a set of brand guidelines. From this, I applied the UI to my wireframes and created versions for a large desktop breakpoint. Creating these larger screens was one of the biggest challenges of this project. I struggled with translating all the information from such a small screen to one with much more real estate. For inspiration, I looked at
          the layout of various different websites, especially banking sites. I also used the layout of social media sites like Facebook and Twitter for inspiration, as their main content scroll uses only around a third of the page. This was the approach I took with my site as well. However, unlike Facebook or Twitter, I left the area on all sides of the main content blank, because I didnâ€™t want the user to be overwhelmed with information or distracted by side elements. I wanted them to be able to concentrate fully on the task at hand.
        </p>

        <p>
          At this point, I made sure my designs were pixel-perfect and aligned to the grid and finalized my screens.

          Finally, I tested my desktop homepage in an A/B preference test to see which version users preferred. Although there was a low response rate and the margin was narrow, users thought this version was a bit cleaner and more professional, with a clearer hierarchy.

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          Although I was given a product brief with most of the information, I would have liked to have done a little more work on discovery and exploring the problem space in the beginning. With information provided, I feel that my solution was effective, but I didn't feel I had the clearest picture of the user's goals that I could have. In the future, I also wouldn't sketch user flows on paper, digitize in Balsamiq, and then design in Sketch. Instead, I would skip the Balsamiq step, which I didn't feel added much to the process. The exception would be if I needed to present my lo-fi wireframes to a client--but even then, I would prefer to user Figma and save myself some time later. Finally, I would send out my preference test again to garner more results in the future, as the margin was too narrow to be confident that my desktop design was really the preferred version. If I had more results, I could be more confident in my decision one way or another.
